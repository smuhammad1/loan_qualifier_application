# Loan Qualifier Application

This is a python command-line interface application that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders based on input. The application works by taking in a criteria from a `daily_rate_sheet` from various loan providers, then prompting the user to input their personal relevant information, and returning a set of avaliable loans with an option to save those loans to a specefic path (in this case, a csv file).
